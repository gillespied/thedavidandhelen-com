There isn't much accommodation near the reception, it is probably best to stay somewhere in town. There are a number of budget hotels:

- [Travelodge Chester Central](https://www.travelodge.co.uk/hotels/367/Chester-Central-hotel)
- [Travelodge Central Bridge Street](https://www.travelodge.co.uk/hotels/647/Chester-Central-Bridge-Street-hotel)
- [Premier Inn Chester City Centre](https://www.premierinn.com/gb/en/hotels/england/cheshire/chester/chester-city-centre.html) - right near the train station.
- [Premier Inn Chester Central South East](https://www.premierinn.com/gb/en/hotels/england/cheshire/chester/chester-central-south-east.html) - free parking and closest budget to reception. You would need a taxi to the Town Hall.
- [The Mill Hotel](http://www.millhotel.com/) - its got a small pool, steam room and gym.

This is not an exhaustive list, there are other hotels, B&Bs and airbnb properties if you prefer.

If you are feeling very flush, there is the 5 star Grosvenor Hotel in the middle of town. Its about Â£250 per night.
