# thedavidandhelen.com

Helen and I are getting married. I'm building this site to help with organising stuff like rsvp responses and givign people information on hotels etc.

## Building the site

You might not know me or Helen, so are probably more interested in how I built it. I started with the gatsby starter:

`gatsby new thedavidandhelen-com.`

I then added a few plugin to help, namely `gatsby-plugins-sass` so that I could make use of bulma. Sass also seems a lot more intuitive than plain css.
